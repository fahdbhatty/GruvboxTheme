This theme consists of the following:

1. Rainmeter skin
-----------------
Included in the package. In case the blured backgroud box doesn't work, you'll need to download the FrostedGlass.dll into your rainmter installation. I wasn't able to add it into my rmskin but it should be an easy enough google search to find. 

2. Wallpapers
-------------
Included in the package. I set mine to rotate every half hour

3. Windows theme
----------------
Gruvbox by niivu (https://www.deviantart.com/niivu/art/gruvbox-for-Windows-11-973849065). The version I'm using is apparently for an older version of Windows 11 but it works well enough for me. This version is more updated and so will look just a little bit different from what I have

niivu usually provides or links very detailed explanations of how to install Windows themes and provides a lot of resources in their downloads. Follow those to make your desktop look as close as possible to theirs. 

The only part at which I deviated was to use StartAllBack instead of Winstep Nexus which I can't stand. Using StartAllBack required me to convert some of the PNG icons to ICO icons. I used GIMP but there are online converters which work well enough

Thanksfully, niivu was thoughful enough to provide settings for StartAllBack as well! 

4. Extra Goodies
----------------
